      <Paragraph>
        Backpack uses a baseline grid to provide consistent vertical rhythm. A baseline grid is an underlying structure
        that helps guide the vertical spacing of a design. Just like using columns for laying out elements horizontally,
        the baseline grid is a way to help you make decisions and build consistency into a layout.
      </Paragraph>,
      <Paragraph>
        Backpackâ€™s baseline grid is set to .375rem (6px) increments, with an optimised font-size, line-height and
        spacing that align to the grid.
      </Paragraph>,
      <Paragraph>You can preview this by switching on the grid at the bottom of the page.</Paragraph>,
